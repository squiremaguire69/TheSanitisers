        <p>The Sanitisers was established in March 2020 as a direct consequence of COVID-19. Harry Hynes and Damian Morgan recognised that there was a need for a service to help business owners reopen and maintain their businesses in an environment that was as COVID-19 safe as possible. Sanitising business premises and offices on a regular basis will give customers and employees confidence and peace of mind while they go about their activities. We at The Sanitisers work with each individual business to identify their specific needs and develop a sanitisation plan accordingly.  We work effectively with a large cross section of the business and social communities, sanitising a diverse range of premises including offices, shops, pubs, restaurants, cinemas, schools, churches and community halls.</p>
